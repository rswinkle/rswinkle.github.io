# LBRY is Awesome
general LBRY
September 10, 2020

I've been using LBRY for a while now and it's made amazing proress in the last couple years in terms of the user experience both of the desktop app (which I use on linux), the android app, and of course [lbry.tv](https://lbry.tv/) which is how most people first experience lbry.  If you haven't heard of LBRY or don't know what it is, I recommend you read [their answer](https://lbry.com/faq/what-is-lbry), but in a nutshell it's both a protocol for sharing files (not just videos, that's just what most use it for) in a decentralized way and also the open source applications built by the company to access those files on the network.

The reason, I'm talking about it (besides it's awesome and I want it to continue to grow and want more creators to post to it in addition, or even instead of Youtube), is that I've been experimenting with [posting](https://lbry.tv/@RobertWinkler:a/quicksort_runtimes:3) [blog](https://lbry.tv/@RobertWinkler:a/C_Cpp_mistakes:2) [posts](https://lbry.tv/@RobertWinkler:a/goodreads_sql:8) there.  Their markdown syntax is slightly different that the python library I use to generate my static site and it renders a little differently (most annoyingly paragraphs have to be all on one line, at least in the desktop app, the result looks better on lbry.tv) but it's worth the minor changes to get the automatic handling of light and dark modes.  If I posted a [raw html](https://lbry.tv/@RobertWinkler:a/c_interpreter:5) file one or the other would not look good since there's no way to detect the mode and change css dynamically afaik.

Eventually, I may even start posting videos or other content on LBRY, but for now I'll just try to mirror blog posts and maybe some project READMEs.
