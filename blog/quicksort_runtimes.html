<h1>Quicksort Runtimes</h1>
<p>September 26, 2015</p>
<p>So I've resolved once again to try to post to this blog once
a week or so.  Hopefully it'll help motivate me to make more
progress on my programming projects so I'll have something
to say.  In addition, maybe I'll eventually make this site
look like it wasn't build in the 90's.</p>
<p>Anyway, I've been tinkering with my collection of sorting algorithms
and the benchmarking program I wrote for them years ago.  I've
also been looking at how to display the timing results in a pretty
graph.  For now I'm playing with <a href="http://matplotlib.org">matplotlib</a> in python.</p>
<p>On to the coding!  I wanted to see how my algorithms stacked up against
the C stdlib qsort function (and C++'s std::sort but I only made a graph
for C).  Since it uses a C style generic quicksort I decided to write
my own version with the same interface and compare all my quicksort
variations.</p>
<ol>
<li>qsort, standard recursive implementation</li>
<li>qsortlib, C's qsort function</li>
<li>genericqsort, my version of above</li>
<li>iterqsort, iterative version of qsort</li>
<li>qinssort, same as 1 but switches to insertion sort &lt;=25 elements</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="Quicksort graph" src="./quicksort_times.png" /></p>
<p>As you can see, the 3 non-generic implementations 1, 4 and 5 all
perform roughly the same, especially at higher N, while the 2
generic versions are about half as fast due to the extra overhead
involved.  My generic version is a tad slower but I think I'll try
adding insertion sort for smaller groups and see if that makes the
difference.</p>
<p>You can see the code I used <a href="https://github.com/rswinkle/sorting/commit/8c8c1f2d980dfe069b0dcc2350ca0ecb4b0f46ac">here</a>.
I compiled it as is but am only talking about main.c, or benchmark, not cppbenchmark.</p>
<p>Running this from the build directry (after build and running benchmark)
will generate the graph.  I had to expand and save it manually ...
I need to figure out sizing the whole image programmatically.
<code>python3 ../plotbarchart.py</code></p>
