# PortableGL
OpenGL C libraries
June 16, 2021

So, it's only 9 months past when I initially released it, but I'm finally
[posting](http://www.robertwinkler.com/projects/portablegl.html) it to my projects
page and writing this perfunctory blog post about it.

In a nutshell, it's a portable, single header library, written in clean-C
(ie C++ safe), implementing OpenGL 3.x ish.  In other words, it runs
entirely on the CPU and its only dependency is C99, though all the
examples and demos use SDL2.

You can read more about it and look at the examples [here](http://portablegl.com).
