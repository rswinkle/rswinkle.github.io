New REPLS
=========
C libraries game
June 25, 2020

A few days ago I added created 4 new repls of 4 of my C projects.  I added repls
for:

* [spelling_game](https://github.com/rswinkle/spelling_game)
* [CPIM2](https://github.com/rswinkle/CPIM2)
* [C_Interpreter](https://github.com/rswinkle/C_Interpreter)
* [sorting](https://github.com/rswinkle/sorting)

These join the one I had for my Goodreads SQLite database.  So you can now try
all of these out in the browser [here](/projects/repls.html)
