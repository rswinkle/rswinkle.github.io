Goodreads + SQL = Fun
=====================
books reading SQL
January 12, 2020

I've been learning SQL (and particularly SQLite) slowly and casually over the
last couple months and as I mentioned in my New Year's post, I want to continue
that and use it in more ways and in more projects.  Thus far I've read through
a lot of SQLite documentation, done a decent number of Hackerrank problems, gone
through the W3Schools questions, and more importantly used SQLite in some random
Python scripts and added a SQLite based implementation to
[CPIM2](https://github.com/rswinkle/CPIM2/tree/sqlite).

I realized soon after starting with SQL that one dataset that would be fun to play with
would be my Goodreads library.  Using their export function which gives you a csv file
and a relatively simple Python script, I could create a SQLite3 database.  Since I had
another few books I wanted to read before the end of the year and plenty more SQL exercises
and such to occupy me I decided to wait so I could have all of 2019 available for analysis
and statistics, and finally it's time.





I've been using Goodreads for several years now and while I've probably missed a book
here and there, I've been reasonably consistent about adding books since I first created
an account.  When I first started I added 100's of books immediately in a futile attempt
to create a definitive list of every book (or at least every fictional one) I've ever read.
