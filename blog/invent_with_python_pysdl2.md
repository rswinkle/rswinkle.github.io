New Project
============
python pysdl2
February 4, 2016

So I updated my website yesterday(I know it still needs a lot of work I'm not
a web developer) and I added several project pages including a new one.

I've been wanting to learn PySDL2 for a while now and a couple months ago I finally
had the motivation to start.  To learn it I decided to port all the games (and other
programs) from ["Making Games with Python & Pygame"](http://inventwithpython.com/pygame/chapters/)
by Al Sweigart.

Al Sweigart, if you haven't heard of him, has 4 python books
and all of them are available for free online along with the source code.
I encourage you to check them out,

I got a little less than half way done, before I felt comfortable enough to move on,
starting my own simple games and soon after I was on vacation with family for about
10 days during the holidays so by the time I came back it was even less on my mind.

I've released what I have to Github/Bitbucket because I think it'll be useful to
people.  I'm thinking about starting a small crowdfunding campaign, probably on
indiegogo, to motivate me to finish it if there's enough interest.

Anyway the project page is [here](/projects/invent_with_python.html) for those
interested.
