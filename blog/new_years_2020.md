New Years Resolutions 2020
==========================
general
January 5, 2020

So it's that time of year again and I figured I'd publicly join in and hope that helps
keep me honest.  I've split the goals into Primary and Secondary.  Secondary is a catchall for
things that would be cool but I'm not super motivated to do and for things that I'll do
naturally and really shouldn't count (like reading fiction).

### Primary
1. Get in running shape, run 2-4x/week, bike ~1x/week
2. Calisthenics 3x/week, weight lifting ~1/week
3. Program 20+ hours a week (not counting paid work)
4. Update website at least once a week (not necessarily a blog post)
5. Continue to learn SQL and Scheme/Racket, use in/for several projects and possible paid work
6. [#ProjectEuler100 Challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/projecteuler100-coding-challenge-competitive-programming/)

### Secondary
1. Learn and do some projects in Rust and Javascript
2. Finish at least [12 fiction books](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/20584334)
3. Finish 12 non-fiction books
4. Get 500+ stars on one of my [Github repos](https://github.com/rswinkle)
5. Get a project into the Debian repos (and maybe the AUR?)

Obviously some are very broad, there's some overlap and there are a lot more specific goals I have
that will be covered/accomplished through say Primary 1-3.

This is kind of the whole Systems vs. Goals thing that Scott Adams and others have been on
for several years.  I think it's a false dichotomy; a system is a goal and most goals are systems.
More than that, there's a chain for large, long term goals.  For example, say my goal is to run a
marathon.  I'd start a year before the race with a plan to run 4-5 times a week working
in a speed every other week.  I'd do 5Ks, then 10Ks, and finally half-marathons every other month.
Those are all systems, or (sub)goals in their own right.  Even finer grained, I'd have systems for
sleeping and eating right in service of those systems/goals.  Basically until you get down to things
that can be accomplished in a day or 2, every goal has systems.  Even something done in a weekend like
a game jam benefitted from goals and systems that came before (learning the tools, general experience
and prior game jams) and you might have  your diet and sleep specifically calibrated for a 48-72 hour
develoment marathon as another system.

Sorry, that was a tangent, but it's always bothered me the whole Systems > Goals.  It's just semantics
and perception.
