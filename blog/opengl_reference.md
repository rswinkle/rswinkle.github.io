New OpenGL Project: opengl_reference
==================
OpenGL C C++
March 7, 2016

I've posted a new project, [opengl_reference](/projects/opengl_reference.html).

As it says, it's going to be a growing repo of small to medium OpenGL programs.
Some will be very simple examples, almost tutorial type programs.  Some will
demonstrate 1 or 2 specific features of OpenGL.  Some will show specific aspects/behavior
of OpenGL (like it's left-handed canonical coordinate system or what happens when you draw
lines on the exact edges of the view volume).  Finally, a couple will be template
programs, meant to be copy-pasted to start new projects of a certain type.

In the course of developing these, I'll be building my OpenGL helper libraries
(math, mesh/buffer/texture/shader management etc.) and refining/improving them.  I'll
also be using/learning glm but I prefer using/writing my own for various reasons.
