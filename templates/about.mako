My name is Robert Winkler. I graduated from Arizona State University in 2012 with a BS degree in Computer Science. I'm trying to use this site and blog to learn web technolgies and languages and as a place to store and organize my various projects. Unfortunately I'm pretty busy with life and work and that has kept me from doing as much as I want to so far.

I can't even think of a title for my blog. For any comments/questions/ideas on or about blog posts or any of my projects please post a comment or email me at rob at blog.robertwinkler.com. If for example you think of a way my code could be improved (very likely) or would like me to include more helpful comments please tell me.
