=================

This is my personal website.  I'm currently using github pages but I've used my own
(virtual) server in the past and it's written in a way to make it easy to go back to
that with just a few minor link changes.

I'm using a custom python script to generate the site, including the blog, based on
mako templates and markdown files.  I kind of want to try asciidoc sometime because
I've heard it's more powerful/flexible than markdown but who knows when/if I'll
ever get to that.

All code and files are (c) Robert Winkler under the MIT license unless otherwise
specified.
