<h1>CVECTOR</h1>

<p><a href="https://www.codementor.io/rswinkle"><img alt="Contact me on Codementor" src="https://cdn.codementor.io/badges/contact_me_github.svg"></a></p>
<p>This is a relatively simple ANSI compliant C vector library with specific structures and
functions for int's, double's and string's and support for all other types
using a generic structure where the type is passed in as void<em> and stored in a byte array
(to avoid dereferencing void</em> warnings and frequent casting) .
The generic vector is very flexible and allows you to provide free and init functions 
if you like that it will call at appropriate times similar to the way C++ containers
will call destructors and copy constructors.</p>
<p>Other modifiable parameters are at the top of vector.c</p>
<pre><code>size_t VEC_I_START_SZ = 50;
size_t VEC_D_START_SZ = 50;
size_t VEC_VOID_START_SZ = 20;
size_t VEC_STR_START_SZ = 20;

#define VEC_I_ALLOCATOR(x) ((x) * 2)
#define VEC_D_ALLOCATOR(x) ((x) * 2)
#define VEC_STR_ALLOCATOR(x) ((x) * 2)
#define VEC_VOID_ALLOCATOR(x) ((x) * 2)
</code></pre>
<p>The allocator macros are used in all functions that increase the size by 1.
In others (constructors, insert_array, reserve) VEC_X_START_SZ is the amount
extra allocated.</p>
<p>There are also 2 templates, one for basic types and one for types that contain
dynamically allocated memory and you might want a free and/or init function.
In other words the first template is based off vector_i and the second is based
off of vector_void, so look at the corresponding documentation for behavior.
There are actually 2 varieties of each template, one all-in-one header variety that works
like c_vector.h, and the other generates a matching c/h pair.</p>
<p>They are located in vector_template.h, vector_template2.h, vector_template3.c/h and
vector_template4.c/h.</p>
<p>To generate your own vector files for a type just run:</p>
<pre><code>python3 generate_code.py yourtype
</code></pre>
<p>which will generate the results for all templates so just delete the ones
you don't want.</p>
<p>vector_short and vector_f_struct are examples of the process and
how to add it to the testing.</p>
<h1>Download</h1>
<p>Get the source from <a href="https://github.com/rswinkle/CVector">Github</a>.</p>
<h1>Building</h1>
<p>I use <a href="http://premake.github.io/">premake</a> so the command on linux is premake4 gmake which
will generate a build directory.  cd into that and run make
or make config=release.  I have not tried it on windows though
it should work (well I'm not sure about CUnit ...).</p>
<p>There is no output of any kind, no errors or warnings.</p>
<p>It has been relatively well tested using Cunit tests which all pass.  You can see
the test results <a href="/projects/cvector/CUnitAutomated-Results.xml">here</a>,
though they only display correctly in Firefox.  The test results and the xsl to dislpay it
as a nice html page are in the testoutput directory.</p>
<p>I've also run it under valgrind and there are no memory leaks.</p>
<pre><code>valgrind --leak-check=yes ./vector

==17650== 
==17650== HEAP SUMMARY:
==17650==     in use at exit: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==17650==   total heap usage: 5,146 allocs, 5,146 frees, 936,924 bytes allocated
==17650== 
==17650== All heap blocks were freed -- no leaks are possible
==17650== 
==17650== ERROR SUMMARY: 0 errors from 0 contexts (suppressed: 2 from 2)
</code></pre>
<p>I plan to continue to improve/modify it but probably only in minor ways and
only if I think something should be changed.  This library is mostly
for my own use but I thought I would share it and use it as a platform
to learn CUnit and Doxygen.</p>
<p>You can probably get Cunit from your package manager but
if you want to get the most up to date version of CUnit go here:</p>
<p>http://cunit.sourceforge.net/index.html
http://sourceforge.net/projects/cunit/</p>
<p>I used version 2.1-2.</p>
<h1>Usage</h1>
<p>To actually use the library just copy the appropriate c/h file pair(s) to your project
or just use cvector.h.
To get a good idea of how to use the library and see it in action and how it should
behave, look at vector_tests.c</p>
<h1>Documentation</h1>
<p>The Doxygen generated html docs are in doc.tar.gz and <a href="http://www.robertwinkler.com/projects/cvector/index.html">online here</a></p>
