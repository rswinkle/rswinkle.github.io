<h1>sdl_img</h1>

<p><a href="https://travis-ci.org/rswinkle/sdl_img"><img alt="Build Status" src="https://travis-ci.org/rswinkle/sdl_img.svg?branch=master"></a>
<a href="https://scan.coverity.com/projects/rswinkle-sdl_img"><img alt="Coverity Scan Build Status" src="https://scan.coverity.com/projects/15740/badge.svg"></a></p>
<p>A "simple" image viewer based on <a href="https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h">stb_image.h</a> (with the suggested animated GIF API extension).</p>
<p>It's "simple" in that it would work fine as a drop in replacement for most people since all the normal/expected behavior is there,
but it has tons of extra and unique features for power users, especially on Linux/Unix and if you're comfortable with the terminal.</p>
<h1>Download</h1>
<p>Get the latest <a href="https://github.com/rswinkle/sdl_img">source</a> or the latest
<a href="https://github.com/rswinkle/sdl_img/releases">release</a> from Github</p>
<h1>Goals / Focus</h1>
<ul>
<li>Implement features I've always wanted in an image viewer</li>
<li>Relatively simple, short, readable code</li>
<li>Learn/Practice/Fun</li>
<li>Not really focused on speed, if it's fast enough on my chromebook it's good enough</li>
</ul>
<h1>Controls/Basic Usage</h1>
<pre><code>./sdl_img image_name.jpg
./sdl_img -f image_name.jpg  (to start in full screen mode)
</code></pre>
<p>Will open image_name.jpg.  On Windows that would be <code>sdl_img.exe</code>, but better
to just right click on an image of each type and change the default application
to be sdl_img.exe and then double clicking any image of that type will open it
with sdl_img.  Left and right will go through images in the same directory in
alphabetical order.</p>

</table>
<p>The most obvious unique features are the multi-image modes but others include
slowing/speeding/pausing gifs, vim inspired thumbnail mode, shuffle/sort etc.</p>
<p>Within each image mode the basic controls work on all images simultaneously
unless a specific image is selected by hitting 1-n and then they operate only
on that image, ie cycling, zooming, fit will only effect that image.
To return to "all at once" mode, hit 0.  In this way you can compare multiple
images simultaneously with a single viewer instance (even if they aren't sequential
alphabetically).  Switching from a higher mode to a lower will show the first n images
of the higher mode where n is the lower number.  An exception is if you have an
image selected and go to single mode, that is the image that will be used.</p>
<p>The slideshow feature is smart enough to wait long enough to finish any gif being
displayed even if that takes longer than the specificed delay.  ESC ends the slideshow.
All other controls work while in slideshow mode, meaning starting a slideshow does not
automatically toggle to fullscreen, it will run in double, quad or oct-image mode, or
even on a single image selected within those modes.</p>
<p>Something to note about the rotation functionality are that while it will rotate any
image, it will only ask whether you're sure you want to save single frame images because
stb_image_write does not support gifs at all, let alone animated gifs.  It will try to
detect the type from the extension and output that type if possible, otherwise jpg is
the default.</p>
<h1>Advanced Usage</h1>
<pre><code>./sdl_img -l list_of_images (urls or local paths or mixed, doesn't matter)
./sdl_img image1.jpg image2.png
./sdl_img image1.jpg -s 4
./sdl_img -l list_of_urls -c ./custom_cache_dir
</code></pre>
<p>Or any combination of those options, ie</p>
<pre><code>./sdl_img image.jpg -l list1 -s 8 example.com/image.jpg -l list3 image4.gif -f
</code></pre>
<p>The option -s [delay] means start in slideshow mode with the given delay in seconds.
If delay is not 1-10 or is missing, delay will be set to 3 seconds.</p>
<p>When using any of these modes, all the images will be collected in a list in the
order they're given (not sorted like basic usage).  For now, if you have multiple
url images with the same name, downloaded on the same day, the one downloaded last
will simply overwrite the earlier ones in the cache.  This is because the cache does
create subdirectories by date of the form YYYY-MM-DD for easy browsing/cleaning.</p>
<p>There is also the -c/--cache option which allows you to specify a custom cache
location (only for this instance) which can be useful if you know you want to
save these images and don't want to bother copying them from the normal cache later.</p>
<h1>Building</h1>
<p>On Linux, just run <code>./build.sh</code> for debug, <code>./build_release.sh</code> for release.</p>
<p>On Windows I use <a href="https://github.com/msys2/msys2/wiki/MSYS2-installation">MSYS2</a>.  I don't
like/use IDE's and I can't stand the Window's command line.  MSYS2 allows me to have the
same environment and tools as Linux.  So it's basically the same, <code>./build_win.sh</code> and
<code>./build_win_release.sh</code>.</p>
<h1>Packaging</h1>
<p>I'll expand this section later, once I get to 1.0 and have packages and
more finalized packaging processes but I'm using
<a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page">NSIS</a> to create my windows installer and
<a href="https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm">fpm</a> on linux to create linux packages.  Maybe
I'll even try something like AppImage or Flatpak long term just for fun.</p>
<h1>Naming Issues</h1>
<p>So I know there are some issues with the name.</p>
<p>Originally sdl_img only used SDL2 and stb_image; <a href="https://github.com/nothings/stb">stb_image</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/nothings/stb-imv">stb_imv</a> already exist,
so I chose sdl_img rather than stb_img.  Unfortunately, SDL_image and SDL2_image
(libsdl-image1.2 and libsdl2-image in repos) also exist so there's a minor clash there too.</p>
<p>Now I'm using the following libraries:
<a href="https://www.libsdl.org">SDL2</a>, <a href="http://www.ferzkopp.net/wordpress/2016/01/02/sdl_gfx-sdl2_gfx/">SDL2_gfx</a>
stb_image, stb_image_write, stb_image_resize
<a href="https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/">libcurl</a>
<a href="https://github.com/vurtun/nuklear">nuklear</a> (immediate mode GUI library)
<a href="https://github.com/WaterJuice/WjCryptLib">WjCryptLibMd5</a></p>
<p>So potential names are stb_img, sdl_img, sdl2_img, sdl_imv, nuklear_img, or
some cool original name that I'm not creative enough to think of.  I'm open to
suggestions.</p>
