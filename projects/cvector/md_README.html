<p><a href="https://github.com/rswinkle/cvector">Download</a></p>
<p>This is a relatively simple ANSI compliant C vector library with specific structures and functions for int's, double's and string's and support for all other types using a generic structure where the type is passed in as void* and stored in a byte array (to avoid dereferencing void* warnings and frequent casting) . The generic vector is very flexible and allows you to provide free and init functions if you like that it will call at appropriate times similar to the way C++ containers will call destructors and copy constructors.</p>
<p>Other modifiable parameters are at the top of the respective cvector.c's </p><pre class="fragment">size_t CVEC_I_START_SZ = 50;
size_t CVEC_D_START_SZ = 50;
size_t CVEC_STR_START_SZ = 20;
size_t CVEC_VOID_START_SZ = 20;

#define CVEC_I_ALLOCATOR(x) ((x+1) * 2)
#define CVEC_D_ALLOCATOR(x) ((x+1) * 2)
#define CVEC_STR_ALLOCATOR(x) ((x+1) * 2)
#define CVEC_VOID_ALLOCATOR(x) ((x+1) * 2)
</pre><p> The allocator macros are used in all functions that increase the size by 1. In others (constructors, insert_array, reserve) CVEC_X_START_SZ is the amount extra allocated.</p>
<p>Note that the (x+1) portion allows you to use the non-void vectors without calling any of the init functions first <em>if</em> you zero them out. This means size, capacity, and a are 0/NULL which is valid because realloc, acts like malloc when given a NULL pointer. With <a class="el" href="structcvector__void.html">cvector_void</a> you still have to set elem_size, and optionally elem_free/elem_init. See the zero_init_x_test()'s in cvector_tests.c for example of that use.</p>
<p>There are also 2 templates, one for basic types and one for types that contain dynamically allocated memory and you might want a free and/or init function. In other words the first template is based off <a class="el" href="structcvector__i.html">cvector_i</a> and the second is based off of <a class="el" href="structcvector__void.html">cvector_void</a>, so look at the corresponding documentation for behavior.</p>
<p>There are 2 ways to use/create your own cvector types. The easiest way is to use the macros defined in <a class="el" href="cvector__macro_8h_source.html">cvector_macro.h</a> which are also included in the all-in-one header <a class="el" href="cvector_8h_source.html">cvector.h</a>. You can see how to use them in cvector_tests.c: </p><pre class="fragment">#define RESIZE(a) (((a)+1)*2)

CVEC_NEW_DECLS(short)
CVEC_NEW_DECLS2(f_struct)

CVEC_NEW_DEFS(short, RESIZE)
CVEC_NEW_DEFS2(f_struct, RESIZE)
</pre><p> The RESIZE macro has to be defined before using the macros for now, serving the same purpose as the regular allocator macros above. Obviously the DECL macros declare type and prototypes while the DEFS define them. Using the macros for user made types is much easier than the files because you can call the macro right in the header where you define the type instead of having to include the type in the generated file. Basically 1 step rather than 2-3 and no extra files needed.</p>
<p>The other way, and the only way in previous versions of CVector, is to generate your own files from the template files which are located in <a class="el" href="cvector__template_8h_source.html">cvector_template.h</a> and <a class="el" href="cvector__template2_8h_source.html">cvector_template2.h</a>.</p>
<p>To generate your own cvector files for a type just run: </p><pre class="fragment">python3 generate_code.py yourtype
</pre><p> which will generate the results for both templates so just delete the one you don't want.</p>
<p><a class="el" href="structcvector__short.html">cvector_short</a> and <a class="el" href="structcvector__f__struct.html">cvector_f_struct</a> are examples of the generated files. While I now test the macros instead of the files, it's the same code, and you can still see how I used to test them.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md0"></a>
Building</h1>
<p>I use <a href="http://premake.github.io/">premake</a> so the command on linux is premake5 gmake which will generate a build directory. cd into that and run make or make config=release. I have not tried it on windows though it should work (well I'm not sure about CUnit ...).</p>
<p>There is no output of any kind, no errors or warnings.</p>
<p>It has been relatively well tested using CUnit tests which all pass. I've also run it under valgrind and there are no memory leaks. </p><pre class="fragment">   valgrind --leak-check=full -v ./cvector
   ==116175==
   ==116175== HEAP SUMMARY:
   ==116175==     in use at exit: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
   ==116175==   total heap usage: 10,612 allocs, 10,612 frees, 1,151,748 bytes allocated
   ==116175==

   ==116175==
   ==116175== ERROR SUMMARY: 0 errors from 0 contexts (suppressed: 0 from 0)
</pre><p>I plan to continue to improve/modify it but probably only in minor ways and only if I think something should be changed. This library is mostly for my own use but I thought I would share it and use it as a platform to learn CUnit and Doxygen.</p>
<p>You can probably get Cunit from your package manager but if you want to get the most up to date version of CUnit go here:</p>
<p><a href="http://cunit.sourceforge.net/index.html">http://cunit.sourceforge.net/index.html</a> <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cunit/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/cunit/</a></p>
<p>I'm using version 2.1-3.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md1"></a>
Usage</h1>
<p>To actually use the library just copy the appropriate c/h file pair(s) to your project or just use <a class="el" href="cvector_8h_source.html">cvector.h</a>. To get a good idea of how to use the library and see it in action and how it should behave, you can look at cvector_tests.c but for more practical examples, you can look at my other projects that use cvector like <a href="https://github.com/rswinkle/c_interpreter">C_Interpreter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rswinkle/cpim2">CPIM2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rswinkle/sdl_img">sdl_img</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rswinkle/c_bigint">c_bigint</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rswinkle/spelling_game">spelling_game</a>.</p>
