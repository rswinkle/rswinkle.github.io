Intro</h1>
<p>This is a relatively simple ANSI compliant C vector library with specific structures and functions for int's, double's and string's and support for all other types using a generic structure where the type is passed in as void* and stored in a byte array (to avoid dereferencing void* warnings and frequent casting) . The generic vector is very flexible and allows you to provide free and init functions if you like that it will call at appropriate times similar to the way C++ containers will call destructors.</p>
<p>Other modifiable parameters are at the top of vector_*.c </p><pre>
size_t VEC_I_START_SZ = 50;
size_t VEC_D_START_SZ = 50;
size_t VEC_VOID_START_SZ = 20;
size_t VEC_STR_START_SZ = 20;</pre><pre>#define <a class="el" href="vector__i_8c.html#a6d9a8fd1aaa4a8df09d79da016a5c5aa">VEC_I_ALLOCATOR(x)</a> ((x) * 2)
#define <a class="el" href="vector__d_8c.html#a024a194564bd2419ca1ac75e3cdec3e8">VEC_D_ALLOCATOR(x)</a> ((x) * 2)
#define <a class="el" href="vector__str_8c.html#ac6b46abc3594994ede1811c5268fa72f">VEC_STR_ALLOCATOR(x)</a> ((x) * 2)
#define <a class="el" href="vector__void_8c.html#a6f86fe931c02dfbb3d901d2f5e5ec969">VEC_VOID_ALLOCATOR(x)</a> ((x) * 2)
</pre><p> The allocator macros are used in all functions that increase the size by 1. In others (constructors, insert_array, reserve) VEC_X_START_SZ is the amount extra allocated.</p>
<p>There are also 2 templates, one for basic types and one for types that contain dynamically allocated memory and you might want a free and/or init function. In other words the first template is based off <a class="el" href="structvector__i.html" title="Data structure for int vector. ">vector_i</a> and the second is based off of <a class="el" href="structvector__void.html" title="Data structure for generic type (cast to void) vectors. ">vector_void</a>, so look at the corresponding documentation for behavior. There are actually 2 varieties of each template, one all-in-one header variety that works like <a class="el" href="cvector_8h.html">cvector.h</a>, and the other generates a matching c/h pair.</p>
<p>They are located in <a class="el" href="vector__template_8h.html">vector_template.h</a>, <a class="el" href="vector__template2_8h.html">vector_template2.h</a>, <a class="el" href="vector__template3_8c.html">vector_template3.c</a>/h and <a class="el" href="vector__template4_8c.html">vector_template4.c</a>/h.</p>
<p>To generate your own vector files for a type just run: </p><pre>
python3 generate_code.py yourtype
</pre><p>which will generate the results for all templates so just delete the ones you don't want.</p>
<p><a class="el" href="structvector__short.html" title="Data structure for short vector. ">vector_short</a> and <a class="el" href="structvector__f__struct.html">vector_f_struct</a> are examples of the process and how to add it to the testing.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="des_notes"></a>
Design Notes</h1>
<p>Memory allocations are checked and asserted. If not in debug mode (ie NDEBUG is defined) 0 is returned on allocation failure.</p>
<p>No other error checking is performed. If you pass bad parameters, bad things will probably happen. This is consistent with my belief that it is the caller's responsibility to pass valid arguments and library code shouldn't be larger/uglier/slower for everyone just to pretty print errors. This is also consistent with the C standard library where, for the most part, passing invalid parameters results in undefined behavior (see section 4.1.6 in C89, 7.1.4 in C99 and C11).</p>
<p>The back functions simply return the address of size - 1. This is fine even if your size is zero for the use of &lt;= back_i(myvec) since the beginning of the array will already be &gt; back. If I were to return NULL in the case of size 0, you'd just exchange a possible size check before the call for a possible NULL check after the call. I choose this way because it doesn't add an if check to the function so it's smaller/faster, I think the &lt;= use case is more likely, and it's easier and more normal to know when your vector is empty than to remember to check for NULL after the fact.</p>
<p>The insert functions (insert_i and insert_array_i for example) do allow you to insert at the end. The memmove inside the functions will simply move 0 bytes if you pass the current size as the index. C99 and C11 guarrantee this behavior in the standard (and thus C++ does as well). Though I wrote this library to be compliant with C89, which does not guarrantee this behavior, I think it's safe to assume they'd use the same implementation since it doesn't contradict C89 and it just makes sense.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="Building"></a>
Building</h1>
<p>I use premake to generate the make files in the build directory. The command is premake5 gmake. cd into build and run make or make config=release. I have not tried it on windows though it should work (well I'm not sure about CUnit ...).</p>
<p>There is no output of any kind, no errors or warnings.</p>
<p>It has been relatively well tested using Cunit tests which all pass. I've also run it under valgrind and there are no memory leaks.</p>
<pre>
valgrind --leak-check=full -v ./vector</pre><pre>==35463==

</pre><p>You can probably get Cunit from your package manager but if you want to get the most up to date version of CUnit go here:</p>
<p><a href="http://cunit.sourceforge.net/index.html">http://cunit.sourceforge.net/index.html</a> <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cunit/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/cunit/</a></p>
<p>I'm using version 2.1-3.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="Usage"></a>
Usage</h1>
<p>To actually use the library just copy the appropriate c/h file pair(s) to your project or just use <a class="el" href="cvector_8h.html">cvector.h</a>. To get a good idea of how to use the library and see it in action and how it should behave, look at <a class="el" href="vector__tests_8c.html">vector_tests.c</a></p>
