Intro</h1>
<p>This is a relatively simple ANSI compliant C vector library with specific structures and functions for int's, double's and string's and support for all other types using a generic structure where the type is passed in as void* and stored in a byte array (to avoid dereferencing void* warnings and frequent casting) . The generic vector is very flexible and allows you to provide CVEC_FREE and init functions if you like that it will call at appropriate times similar to the way C++ containers will call destructors.</p>
<p>Other modifiable parameters are at the top of the respective cvector.c's </p><pre>
size_t CVEC_I_START_SZ = 50;
size_t CVEC_D_START_SZ = 50;
size_t CVEC_STR_START_SZ = 20;
size_t CVEC_VOID_START_SZ = 20;</pre><pre>#define <a class="el" href="cvector__i_8c.html#a1c3b4d9cc9c546a4cc52ad391f4d8e6e">CVEC_I_ALLOCATOR(x)</a> ((x+1) * 2)
#define <a class="el" href="cvector__d_8c.html#ac8fb90dc7cfcf6456fc114b469454711">CVEC_D_ALLOCATOR(x)</a> ((x+1) * 2)
#define <a class="el" href="cvector__str_8c.html#ad52d33ab8f1a1f6293838122272fef45">CVEC_STR_ALLOCATOR(x)</a> ((x+1) * 2)
#define <a class="el" href="cvector__void_8c.html#a216578f1df3db043455ff44621713ba7">CVEC_VOID_ALLOCATOR(x)</a> ((x+1) * 2)
</pre><p> The allocator macros are used in all functions that increase the size by 1. In others (constructors, insert_array, reserve) CVEC_X_START_SZ is the amount extra allocated.</p>
<p>Note that the (x+1) portion allows you to use the non-void vectors without calling any of the init functions first <em>if</em> you zero them out. This means size, capacity, and a are 0/NULL which is valid because realloc acts like malloc when given a NULL pointer. With <a class="el" href="structcvector__void.html" title="Data structure for generic type (cast to void) vectors. ">cvector_void</a> you still have to set elem_size, and optionally elem_free/elem_init. See the zero_init_x_test()'s in <a class="el" href="cvector__tests_8c.html">cvector_tests.c</a> for example of that use.</p>
<p>There are also 2 templates, one for basic types and one for types that contain dynamically allocated memory and you might want a CVEC_FREE and/or init function. In other words the first template is based off <a class="el" href="structcvector__i.html" title="Data structure for int vector. ">cvector_i</a> and the second is based off of <a class="el" href="structcvector__void.html" title="Data structure for generic type (cast to void) vectors. ">cvector_void</a>, so look at the corresponding documentation for behavior.</p>
<p>There are 2 ways to use/create your own cvector types. The easiest way is to use the macros defined in <a class="el" href="cvector__macro_8h.html">cvector_macro.h</a> which are also included in the all-in-one header <a class="el" href="cvector_8h.html">cvector.h</a>. You can see how to use them in <a class="el" href="cvector__tests_8c.html">cvector_tests.c</a>: </p><pre class="fragment">#define RESIZE(a) ((a)*2)

CVEC_NEW_DECLS(short)
CVEC_NEW_DECLS2(f_struct)

CVEC_NEW_DEFS(short, RESIZE)
CVEC_NEW_DEFS2(f_struct, RESIZE)
</pre><p>The RESIZE macro has to be defined before using the macros for now, serving the same purpose as the regular allocator macros above. Obviously the DECL macros declare type and prototypes while the DEFS define them. Using the macros for user made types is much easier than the files because you can call the macro right in the header where you define the type instead of having to include the type in the generated file. Basically 1 step rather than 2-3 and no extra files needed.</p>
<p>The other way, and the only way in previous versions of CVector, is to generate your own files from the template files which are located in <a class="el" href="cvector__template_8h.html">cvector_template.h</a> and <a class="el" href="cvector__template2_8h.html">cvector_template2.h</a>.</p>
<p>To generate your own cvector files for a type just run: </p><pre class="fragment">python3 generate_code.py yourtype
</pre><p>which will generate the results for both templates so just delete the one you don't want.</p>
<p><a class="el" href="structcvector__short.html" title="Data structure for short vector. ">cvector_short</a> and <a class="el" href="structcvector__f__struct.html">cvector_f_struct</a> are examples of the generated files. While I now test the macros instead of the files, it's the same code, and you can still see how I used to test them.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="des_notes"></a>
Design Notes</h1>
<p>Memory allocations are checked and asserted. If not in debug mode (ie NDEBUG is defined) 0 is returned on allocation failure.</p>
<p>No other error checking is performed. If you pass bad parameters, bad things will probably happen. This is consistent with my belief that it is the caller's responsibility to pass valid arguments and library code shouldn't be larger/uglier/slower for everyone just to pretty print errors. This is also consistent with the C standard library where, for the most part, passing invalid parameters results in undefined behavior (see section 4.1.6 in C89, 7.1.4 in C99 and C11).</p>
<p>The back functions simply return the address of size - 1. This is fine even if your size is zero for the use of &lt;= back_i(myvec) since the beginning of the array will already be &gt; back. If I were to return NULL in the case of size 0, you'd just exchange a possible size check before the call for a possible NULL check after the call. I choose this way because it doesn't add an if check to the function so it's smaller/faster, I think the &lt;= use case is more likely, and it's easier and more normal to know when your vector is empty than to remember to check for NULL after the fact.</p>
<p>The insert functions (insert_i and insert_array_i for example) do allow you to insert at the end. The CVEC_MEMMOVE inside the functions will simply move 0 bytes if you pass the current size as the index. C99 and C11 guarrantee this behavior in the standard (and thus C++ does as well). Though I wrote this library to be compliant with C89, which does not guarrantee this behavior, I think it's safe to assume they'd use the same implementation since it doesn't contradict C89 and it just makes sense.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="Building"></a>
Building</h1>
<p>I use premake to generate the make files in the build directory. The command is premake5 gmake. cd into build and run make or make config=release. I have not tried it on windows though it should work (well I'm not sure about CUnit ...).</p>
<p>There is no output of any kind, no errors or warnings.</p>
<p>It has been relatively well tested using CUnit tests which all pass. I've also run it under valgrind and there are no memory leaks.</p>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="Usage"></a>
Usage</h1>
<p>To actually use the library just copy the appropriate c/h file pair(s) to your project or just use <a class="el" href="cvector_8h.html">cvector.h</a>. To get a good idea of how to use the library and see it in action and how it should behave, look at <a class="el" href="cvector__tests_8c.html">cvector_tests.c</a></p>
