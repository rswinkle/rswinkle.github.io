MIPS Assembly Programming
=========================

"MIPS Assembly Programming" is a free book teaching MIPS assembly targeted primarily at
college students taking classes that use MIPS and commonly use SPIM, QtSpim, or MARS
simulators.  It covers all the basics: data declaration, syscalls, branching, looping, the
calling convention and recursive functions, even floating point numbers.  It should
make the programming portion of such classes much easier.
