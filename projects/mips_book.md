MIPS Assembly Programming
=========================

"MIPS Assembly Programming" is a free book teaching MIPS assembly targeted primarily at
college students taking classes that use MIPS and commonly use SPIM, QtSpim, or MARS
simulators.  It covers all the basics: data declaration, syscalls, branching, looping, the
calling convention and recursive functions, even floating point numbers.  It should
make the programming portion of such classes much easier.  It might also
be helpful to those taking a similar class using RISC-V as it is very similar to MIPS
and the general assembly programming concepts are universal.
