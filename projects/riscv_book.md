RISC-V Assembly Programming
=========================

"RISC-V Assembly Programming" is a free book teaching RISC-V assembly targeted primarily at
college students taking classes that use RISC-V and commonly use RARS or Venus
simulators.  It covers all the basics: data declaration, ecalls, branching, looping, the
calling convention and recursive functions, even floating point numbers.  It should
make the programming portion of such classes much easier.
